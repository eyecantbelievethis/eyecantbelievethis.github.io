		<span class="dialogue">It is, uh, 4:00 AM right now.</span>
		</p>
		<p>
		<span class="dialogue">Uh, Mark is... I, I don't know where Mark is and, um, I'm sorry.</span>
		</p>
		<p>
		<span class="dialogue">Uh, D is, With Jesse's, uh, parents or maybe the cops? I, I don't know. I, I don't know what happened.</span>
		</p>
		<p>
		<span class="dialogue">All I know is, oh God, what am I even saying? Uh, alright. Okay, so, um, yesterday, uh, Jesse and I were supposed to, um, meet and interview, um, uh, Dr. Lance Ruttland together, but she, she didn't show. I thought she'd just forgotten. Um, but then she wouldn't answer D's calls. And, uh, when D went to her house, uh, her parents thought she'd been with D.</span>
		</p>
		<p>
		<span class="dialogue">It's now been 36 hours since anyone has, oh God, since anyone last saw Jesse. I came out to the shed, um, I, I couldn't sleep and I, uh, I found another tape.</span>
		</p>
		<p>
		<span class="dialogue">Another cassette, uh, recorded and left for well, left for me. I, I don't wanna post this. I'm sorry to anyone listening, but I have to. I, I have to. Otherwise... otherwise, I don't know what will happen.</span>

		<span class="dialogue">Dearest new friends of the Tiny Terrors podcast, let me welcome you to the underbelly of the Exchange. The exchange has been the subject of my discerning ear for decades now. And as it approaches its twilight, you breathe new life into it. I have been put in charge of watching the exchange and waiting for its second coming.</span>
		</p>
		<p>
		<span class="dialogue">I am not the first. There were others who watched for its rebirth before me. Do you know the history of the exchange? Do you know what secrets lie within the many stories of the exchange? I see you have brought new blood into the exchange. Fresh, young blood. Why have you given the exchange new blood? I wonder if you know.</span>
		</p>
		<p>
		<span class="dialogue">I will find out.</span>
		</p>
		<p>
		<span class="dialogue">Why did you feed the beast?</span>
		</p>
		<p>
		<span class="dialogue">Tsk. Tsk. Tsk. Now you cannot stop. You think you can, but you won't. The mysteries are too delicious. The mysteries are too many not to be found. You must continue and you must not stop. You are a feral dog and must be taught to heel, and so I have sent my dog to teach you this lesson.</span>
		</p>
		<p>
		<span class="dialogue">Who am I? I am the Listener. I am the master. I am the hand that will teach you to heal. I have been in control of the exchange for the better part of two decades now. Those who came before gave it to me. You are not the first to bring fresh blood, young blood to the exchange. Others before you have as well. I told them not to.</span>
		</p>
		<p>
		<span class="dialogue">Some have listened, some have not.</span>
		</p>
		<p>
		<span class="dialogue">You have not listened and now I listen because you do not. I listen to your podcast many times a day. It lets me track you. I can listen to you and know you. I hear you. And by your voice I can see you. The exchange is my life, my obsession, and now you are too Terrorizers. You have given the exchange fresh blood, but it is my job to watch and listen and wait for the day when the fresh young blood will be mine.</span>
		</p>
		<p>
		<span class="dialogue">Do you want to know who I am? Do you want to know why I must teach you to heel? Do you want to know what you feed?</span>
		</p>
		<p>
		<span class="dialogue">I will tell you. I will tell you if you listen. Will you be a good boy and listen now, Cole? Will you listen now that I have taken one of your Terrorizers? Will her blood be the first I take or will you listen?</span>
		</p>
		<p>
		<span class="dialogue">Enter this into the exchange. Show your listeners who you are, show your fans what they do when they breathe new life into the exchange. They give me new life, which I may take for my own. And now we are past the point where you might have turned it around. Now they carry the burden too.</span>
		</p>
		<p>
		<span class="dialogue">I crave young blood. Fresh blood. I want it. It has been so long since I have let my dog loose. He is frothing at the mouth. His eyes are not too human. They are not human. They are less than human. He is my pet and will do as I ask. So you must do as I ask... or he will hunt you.</span>
		</p>
		<p>
		<span class="dialogue">Post this to the exchange. Make many copies, submit them. Post this to your podcast. When you heel and do as you are asked, I will begin to show you the many delicious secrets hidden in the exchange.</span>
		</p>
		<p>
		<span class="dialogue">Because you have come so far, I will give you this one chance you may not stop now. Now you must obey me.</span>
		</p>
		<p>
		<span class="dialogue">The exchange, and you, and they, the Terrorizers, listeners of your podcast, are now my obsession. Do as I ask and I will return the fresh blood I have taken.</span>

		<span class="dialogue">D's heard the tape and so has Mark, and now you've heard it. I don't really know what else to say at this point. I just, I just feel like this is, I just feel like this is all my fault.</span>
