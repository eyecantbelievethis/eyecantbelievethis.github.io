		</p>
<br>
	<p class="name">Cole</p>
		<p>
		<span class="dialogue">Um, a couple weeks ago I received a letter with a list of, um, names on them, and one of them was yours.</span>
		</p>
<br>
	<p class="name">Donny Sums</p>
		<p>
		<span class="dialogue">So?</span>
		</p>
<br>
	<p class="name">Cole</p>
		<p>
		<span class="dialogue">I looked up the other names on the list and,</span>
		</p>
<br>
	<p class="name">Donny Sums</p>
		<p>
		<span class="dialogue">All right. I don't see what this has to do with me. We're done here.</span>
		</p>
<br>
	<p class="name">Cole</p>
		<p>
		<span class="dialogue">All the rest of the other people named are dead, save for you and one other person. Most of them died under mysterious circumstances and I'm just trying to figure out who the hell sent the letter.</span>
		</p>
<br>
	<p class="name">Donny Sums</p>
		<p>
		<span class="dialogue">Okay. Who was the other person?</span>
		</p>
<br>
	<p class="name">Cole</p>
		<p>
		<span class="dialogue">It was, it was me.</span>
		</p>
<br>
	<p class="soundcue">(Tape recorder sounds)</p>
<br>
	<p class="name">Donny Sums</p>
		<p>
		<span class="dialogue">I'd been a member of the Tiny Terrors Exchange for six odd years by the time I got my first publishing contract. It was a straight to paperback publishing run on a very limited printing, but as you probably know, seeing as how you are now here harassing me, the 'Morgue Choir' quickly became an underground success, and then eventually landed on just about every best sellers list you could imagine.</span>
		</p>
		<p>
		<span class="dialogue">That was 1992. Right around the time the members were starting to abandon the bulletin board system in favor of the second iteration of the Tiny Terrors Exchange through the mail system. It made sense enough at the time, I suppose, to do it that way. The technology just wasn't there yet, and yes, the bulletin board system worked for sharing a short story, but anything over 1200 words took forever to load. Traditional means of sending mail to one another was just more efficient, no matter how enthusiastic we were. Compared to nowadays with the internet, you'd laugh, but back then the feedback on a story was nearly instant. I'd post a story before going to sleep and wake up the next day, go to work, and when I got home, I'd have two or three comments waiting for me.</span>
		</p>
		<p>
		<span class="dialogue">In fact, I don't think I'd ever have written the Morgue Choir if I hadn't been a member of the exchange. Those comments really gave me the courage to begin writing in earnest. Actually, I know I wouldn't have written the Morgue Choir if I hadn't been active on the exchange because it's actually based on a story I wrote for the Tiny Terrors Exchange.</span>
		</p>
		<p>
		<span class="dialogue">It was the first story I wrote and submitted that ever made it big time. It was also the story that really convinced me abandoning the bulletin board system was a good idea. The stories just spread in a way that seemed special. Like getting a good story was a cherished parcel from a loved one. Anyway, I titled the story Corpse Singer.</span>
		</p>
		<p>
		<span class="dialogue">I printed out a handful of copies with my full name and the title proudly printed in bolder and bigger font and figured I'd play the numbers game, send them all to a handful of exchange members I knew would pass it on and hope one of those copies gained traction. But it seemed I had over-planned and underprepared because within a month I was receiving more mail than I could conceivably read all by my lonesome.</span>
		</p>
		<p>
		<span class="dialogue">Long story short, I adapted the short story and based my first novel on it. Most folks were happy for me. I got a lot of letters from exchange members looking for me to sign one of those original copies, which frankly felt out of order. Of course, I didn't and just removed as many copies as I could from circulation.</span>
		</p>
		<p>
		<span class="dialogue">I had a book coming out and figured it would improve sales if there weren't free copies that were shorter in length and ruined the plot twist. Anyways, it's important to note that most folk were happy for me, but not everyone. There were purists sending me scolding letters for cashing out, a a healthy supply of death threats, solicitations... and a few letters I would call odd.</span>
		</p>
		<p>
		<span class="dialogue">None of them stood out at the time. You just get letters from less well adjusted people when you find fame and fortune. It starts early and never stops. You can't let it bother you of course. All you can do is laugh. That's why I keep 'em. I look back on him for inspiration when I'm feeling burned out and looking for a creative use of the English language to spur on inspiration.</span>
		</p>
		<p>
		<span class="dialogue">A year or two after I published the Morgue Choir, I was on a press junket going from late night show to late night show when what I assumed was a fan approached me on the street, as I was walking back to my hotel. He stuck out his hand, as if to shake mine but said nothing to accompany the friendly gesture.</span>
		</p>
		<p>
		<span class="dialogue">So I took his hand, thinking it was going to be a quick and painless encounter where someone a little more awkward than the average individual wanted to let me know they appreciated my work. But as I went in gingerly to lightly shake his hand, he grabbed me and pulled me in close. My heart was pounding outta my chest.</span>
		</p>
		<p>
		<span class="dialogue">Was he a stalker and assassin looking for infamy? I began tearing my arm away, trying to shake loose the grip he had on my hand, but he pulled me in closer. I could hear his heavy breath like a hurricane in my ear.</span>
		</p>
		<p>
		<span class="dialogue">God, I can still smell his breath. It was rancid, like spoiled wine, mumbling. He said, Nathan Lansdown, Jamie Pete, Marlon Gunter.</span>
		</p>
		<p>
		<span class="dialogue">It was nonsense. For all I knew they were his imaginary friends for goodness sake. And then, as I was finding it hard to hold back a little laugh, he said my name.</span>
		</p>
		<p>
		<span class="dialogue">"Why did you feed the beast?"</span>
		</p>
		<p>
		<span class="dialogue">Absolute fear grip me in that moment as if I'd been dunked in ice water. My skin pricked and I felt danger in his tone, like static electricity that made the hair on the back of my neck stand up. I tried to cry out for help, but my tongue was too dry and stuck to the roof of my mouth. I swallowed hard and tried once more to yell for help. All the while he held me tight, and mumbled more random names that meant nothing to me, and then more clearly whispered my name in my ear.</span>
		</p>
		<p>
		<span class="dialogue">"Why did you feed the beast?"</span>
		</p>
		<p>
		<span class="dialogue">And he just let me go. The reason I'm telling you this now is because those words stuck with me, the rest of the press junket. Why were those words so familiar? Why did I feed the beast? A week after I got home it hit me though why the question had seemed so familiar. It was like that feeling of having the name of a movie star on the tip of your tongue, but thinking of every other name except the one you're looking for.</span>
		</p>
		<p>
		<span class="dialogue">I had my assistant bring up my collection of letters, and after a quick search, it was there, a letter I'd received shortly after submitting Corpse Singer to the exchange, before I ever published the Morgue Choir. A lined piece of paper with the words, "Why did you feed the beast? Why did you feed the beast? Why did you feed the beast?" It was written over and over and in the creases and in every available space until the letters were too small to read.</span>
		</p>
		<p>
		<span class="dialogue">It was the same person.</span>
		</p>
		<p>
		<span class="dialogue">They'd found me, they'd followed me. They'd stalked me. They'd found me and grabbed me, whispered those same words into my ear all those years later.</span>

	<p class="name">Donny Sums</p>
		<p>
		<span class="dialogue">I'll tell you what my psychiatrist told me. It was likely a super fan, naming off his favorite Tiny Terrors authors. So congratulations. Guess you made the list.</span>

<br>

		<p>
		<span class="soundcue">(Paper unfolding)</span>
		</p>
<br>
	<p class="name">Cole</p>
		<p>
		<span class="dialogue">Here. That's the list of names I got in the mail. And by mail I mean it just sort of appeared on my desk. Um, I've looked up every name and they're all either missing, murdered, or just plain dead except for you and me.</span>
		</p>
<br>
	<p class="name">Donny Sums</p>
		<p>
		<span class="dialogue">All right. Listen mate. Very funny. Who put you up to this? My agent, Janet? Bet it was Janet.</span>
		</p>
<br>
	<p class="name">Cole</p>
		<p>
		<span class="dialogue">Honest to God. This isn't a prank. It's, it's right there. "Why did you feed the beast?" just like in your story and the list of names, just like in your story, I promise. I promise this isn't a prank. Just look into it yourself and you'll see I'm telling the truth.</span>
		</p>
<br>
	<p class="name">Donny Sums</p>
		<p>
		<span class="dialogue">Nathan Lansdown, Jamie Pete, Marlin Gunter. Oh, piss off.</span>

<br>
	<p class="name">Cole</p>

		</p>
<br>
	<p class="name">Cole</p>
		<p>
		<span class="dialogue">No, that's, no, that's not it at all. How, How would I know you'd tell me that story. How many insane little factors would have to align for this to work out the way you are imagining it?</span>
		</p>
<br>

<br>
	<p class="name">D</p>

		<span class="dialogue">Okay. I, I know there's a lot to unpack there, but I still just can't believe you went and met Donny Sums without me.</span>
		</p>
<br>
	<p class="name">Mark</p>
		<p>
		<span class="dialogue">Right?</span>
		</p>
<br>
	<p class="name">Cole</p>

		<span class="dialogue">Yep. Same creepy guy. Stopped both of you.</span>
		</p>
<br>

		<p>
		<span class="dialogue">Okay. Yeah. But like why you, Donny Sums wrote Morgue Choir, one of the most famous stories in the exchange, but like what have you done?</span>
		</p>

<br>
	<p class="name">D</p>

		<span class="dialogue">I, I mean, not Donny Sums success though.</span>
		</p>
<br>
	<p class="name">Cole</p>
		<p>
		<span class="dialogue">Yeah. Okay. Okay. I don't know. Maybe it has something to do with the podcast. You know, they, they don't like that I'm taking the exchange back online maybe?</span>

<br>
	<p class="name">Jesse</p>
		<p>
		<span class="dialogue">What would be so bad about bringing the exchange back online?</span>
		</p>
<br>
	<p class="name">Cole</p>
		<p>
		<span class="dialogue">Nothing, I don't think.</span>
		</p>
<br>
	<p class="name">D</p>
		<p>
		<span class="dialogue">Sure it isn't some like unwritten rule that you can't post it online?</span>
		</p>
<br>
	<p class="name">Cole</p>
		<p>
		<span class="dialogue">I'm sure someone somewhere might think it is.</span>
		</p>
<br>
	<p class="name">Mark</p>
		<p>
		<span class="dialogue">Well maybe it's just a super fan who really liked one of your mediocre stories.</span>
		</p>
<br>
	<p class="name">Cole</p>
		<p>
		<span class="dialogue">Okay. I do in fact have feelings, you know that right?</span>
		</p>
<br>
	<p class="name">Mark</p>
		<p>
		<span class="dialogue">Look, I'm sorry. I don't mean it, but Dog house.</span>
		</p>
<br>
	<p class="name">D</p>
		<p>
		<span class="dialogue">Dog house.</span>
		</p>
<br>
	<p class="name">Cole</p>
		<p>
		<span class="dialogue">Right, okay. Yeah. Fine. Fair.</span>
		</p>
<br>
	<p class="name">Mark</p>
		<p>
		<span class="dialogue">Okay. Where do we go from here?</span>
		</p>
<br>
	<p class="name">D</p>
		<p>
		<span class="dialogue">Hmm. Maybe we try and find out more about the exchange?</span>
		</p>
<br>
	<p class="name">Cole</p>
		<p>
		<span class="dialogue">What's that gonna do?</span>
		</p>
<br>
	<p class="name">D</p>
		<p>
		<span class="dialogue">Okay, so like when I was in university, we had folks come and guest lecture about the most random stuff. We're talking about folks with PhDs talking about dog breeding in middle aged Spain, or like patriarchal roots of the aerobics craze in the late seventies and eighties.</span>
		</p>
		<p>
		<span class="dialogue">Wild stuff. There has to be like, I don't know, what do you wanna call it uhhhh? Scholar of the Tiny Terrors Exchange? You know, someone who's tried to put together the pieces or at least document some of the more notable events orbiting the exchange. Maybe there's like a history of... I don't know, a less dark way to put this, but like a history of murder here?</span>
