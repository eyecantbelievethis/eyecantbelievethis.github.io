		<p>
		<span class="dialogue">This is entry 008. Original exchange is dated, uh... uh- well, now?</span>
		</p>
		<p>
		<span class="dialogue">Uh -</span>
		<span class="soundcue"> (Clears throat) </span>
		<span class="dialogue">Author and original recording by... uh... uh-</span>
		</p>
<br>
	<p class="name">D</p>
		<p>
		<span class="dialogue">Uh- ahh... I, I think it's safe to say a-at this moment we are unsure who wrote and recorded this, but we <i>can</i> say that they might be trying to murder Cole. Aaand it freaked him out so much that he's not present for this.</span>
		</p>
<br>
	<p class="name">Mark</p>
		<p>
		<span class="dialogue">Y'know, this might be a podcasting first. Y'know, 'listen to the voice of the person who's going to kill us all! Potentially!' It's like a, y'know, a true crime podcast, in... reverse. Heh. Not at all what this is <i>supposed</i> to be, but uh, well here we are then, eh?</span>
		</p>
<br>
	<p class="name">Jesse</p>
		<p>
		<span class="dialogue">So... what we're about to listen to is the person stalking Cole, or us, or whatever?</span>
		</p>
<br>
	<p class="name">D</p>
		<p>
		<span class="dialogue">That's the idea! Cole thinks one of the voices is of the man that he met in the alley.</span>
		</p>
<br>
	<p class="name">Mark</p>
		<p>
		<span class="dialogue">Wait a second. Wait a second. <i>Is</i> this a good idea?</span>
		</p>
<br>
	<p class="name">D</p>
		<p>
		<span class="dialogue">Ahh... nn... no idea. But at least, if anything, there's like a record of it, or - y'know, it's public? And, maybe we can crowdsource a little investigative power?</span>
		</p>
<br>
	<p class="name">Jesse</p>
		<p>
		<span class="soundcue">(Sigh) </span>
		<span class="dialogue">I still think we should take this to the police.</span>
		</p>
<br>
	<p class="name">Mark</p>
		<p>
		<span class="dialogue">And what are the police gonna do? There is <i>literally</i> no evidence of a crime.</span>
		</p>
		<p>
		<span class="dialogue">Look, do you ever watch one of those late night documentaries about stalkers - you know the ones, right? - it's ridiculous. Until they <i>actually</i> hurt you, or there's <i>some</i> shred of evidence of a crime, they can't do a bloody thing about it.</span>

<br>
	<p class="name">D</p>
		<p>
		<span class="soundcue">(Sigh) </span>
		<span class="dialogue">Yeah.</span>

		<p>
