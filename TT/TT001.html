		<span class="dialogue">Okay, ah... How do I start this?</span>
		</p>
		<p>
		<span class="dialogue">I guess, um... entry 001? The author is... uh... unknown? And, recording by Cole Weavers. I, I think that's all that needs to be said. I guess, I guess we'll work on that.</span>

	<p class="name">Cole</p>
		<p>
		<span class="dialogue">The orphanage was in an old, abandoned building that had been repurposed. It sat at the edge of a prairie forest, with thin, tall birch trees planted in uncomfortably symmetrical rows. Perfectly straight, perfectly thin. The type of forest that hurt your eyes as you ran through it because of just how unnatural it seemed as the trees whizzed by.</span>
		</p>
		<p>
		<span class="dialogue">It was the type of unnatural forest, where something unnatural itself might live, hiding behind the thin, tall, sparse birch trees, almost nearly as tall itself, but more slender.</span>
		</p>
		<p>
		<span class="dialogue">The children living at the orphanage loved it, though. The trees were that perfect distance from one another, where you could rip a branch from one tree and hang it across another two trees, and lean more branches and twigs and leaves against that - before long, you ended up with a tiny little humble getaway... from the crowded rooms, and the halls of the orphanage.</span>
		</p>
		<p>
		<span class="dialogue">And at night, the little green coin-shaped leaves would all rustle, like a paper tambourine, and the wind wishing those children goodnight through their windows, all cracked open three fingers width. The children loved the sound of that odd little birch forest. They would've opened the windows wider if it weren't for the bars on the outside keeping the children in at night.</span>
		</p>
		<p>
		<span class="dialogue">Now, life wasn't perfect, but the children were happy. They made their own games, and invented their own worlds - told each other stories, and, they were fed. They had a bed to sleep in and a roof above their heads, and while the love they recieved was tough, and they existed knowing that one day they might be taken away from their friends... or even worse, never leave at all. They were still happy at the end of each day.</span>
		</p>
		<p>
		<span class="dialogue">But that orphanage no longer sits at the edge of that odd, unsettling prairie forest filled with children. And there is no more love, no little children tucked into bed, listening to the rustling jazz of birch leaves blowing in the wind. The brick walls have all crumbled, the shingles have all fallen from the roof, and the wood bones of it have rotted clean through.</span>
		</p>
		<p>
		<span class="dialogue">It's been many years since all those children died out there. And many stories have been told about who did it, and it seems the further away it is in time, the more stories you hear, but... I-I know the truth.</span>
		</p>
		<p>
		<span class="dialogue">Do you want to know who killed <i>every</i> last child at that orphanage?</span>
		</p>
		<p>
		<span class="dialogue">I'll tell you.</span>
		</p>
		<p>
		<span class="dialogue">The killer stalked the halls, moving silently as it crept along. Room after room as the children slept and drempt of mothers and fathers, brothers and sisters - the killer moved unheard. Killing one after another after another. The rooms were filled tight with children sleeping in bunk beds - one atop another seperated by metal bedframes and thin, lumpy mattresses.</span>
		</p>
		<p>
		<span class="dialogue">Not one child moved, or woke, as the killer entered the room, taking the breath of the adolescent sleeping closest to the door and moving its way inwards.</span>
		</p>
		<p>
		<span class="dialogue">Police didn't arrive until the sky was already filled with the sickly yellow prelude to dawn, and, by <i>that</i> time there was nothing they could do. According to the incident report released by police there were eighty-six victims - all but two of them were children. They died one by one, until the rest died all at once.</span>
		</p>
		<p>
		<span class="dialogue">I wish I could say it meant something. That it was all part of a larger story, or that there was <i>justice</i> served after all those lives were cut short, but it wasn't, and there could never be.</span>
		</p>
		<p>
		<span class="dialogue">The fire spread slowly, and everyone should've been able to evacuate. A-And they could have, if there was a fire alarm, or sprinklers, or someone hadn't fallen asleep with a cigarette limply pinched between their fingers. The building was just too old, and there was just too little money to spend on orphans and not enough staff, and the staff they did have were old and tired and worn out.</span>
		</p>
		<p>
		<span class="dialogue">Someone fell asleep. It's as simple as that.</span>
		</p>
		<p>
		<span class="dialogue">Eighty-six lives were lost. Not to the slender thing in the woods hiding behind the birch trees, but, to a cigarette, an overworked janitor, and a ratty old carpet. A-At least that's what the incident report released by police <i>claimed,</i> but... I'm inclined to believe it.</span>
		</p>
		<p>
		<span class="dialogue">After all, what else could it have been?</span>

		<span class="dialogue">Yeah, same.</span>
		</p>
<br>
	<p class="name">Cole</p>
		<p>
		<span class="dialogue">Not what you were expecting in a good way, or a bad way?</span>
		</p>

	<p class="name">D</p>
		<p>
		<span class="dialogue">I-I just wasn't expecting that ending.</span>
		</p>
<br>
	<p class="name">Mark</p>
		<p>
		<span class="dialogue">Yeah. Same.</span>

<br>

		<p>
		<span class="dialogue">I mean, most scary stories have monsters, or...</span>

		<p>
		<span class="dialogue">Or some satanic doomsday...</span>
		</p>
<br>
	<p class="name">D</p>
		<p>
		<span class="dialogue">But this one was just... I-I don't know, it... made me sad? But it also like, made me terrified, thinking about how much of my own safety is left to others? Like, I-I just <i>trust</i> that the bus driver had a good sleep last night while I stare at my phone, you know?</span>
		</p>
<br>
	<p class="name">Mark</p>
		<p>
		<span class="dialogue">If that actually happened, who would you blame? Like, if this happened to you, in your town, who do you think everyone would point the finger at? The <i>janitor?</i></span>
		</p>
<br>
	<p class="name">D</p>
		<p>
		<span class="dialogue">I'd personally blame the administration who didn't pony up the cash to hire more staff.</span>
		</p>
<br>
	<p class="name">Cole</p>
		<p>
		<span class="dialogue">Uh, how so?</span>
		</p>
<br>
	<p class="name">D</p>
		<p>
		<span class="dialogue">Clearly someone made the decision to cut the budget.</span>
		</p>
<br>
	<p class="name">Mark</p>
		<p>
		<span class="dialogue">Ooh, nameless Data Entry Intern #4 was the killer all along!</span>

		<p>
		<span class="dialogue">Basically.</span>
		</p>
<br>
	<p class="name">Mark</p>
		<p>
		<span class="soundcue">(Sigh) </span>
		<span class="dialogue">In all seriousness, though, this very well could've just happened <i>any</i> number of times. Of course, it wouldn't be headline news, because there's no 'Flash Killer' or headline beyond, uh, I dunno, 'Tired Janitor Drops Cigarette After Being Horribly Overworked.'</span>
		</p>
<br>
	<p class="name">Cole</p>
		<p>
		<span class="dialogue">Well, I mean, that's all great feedback, but... but was it... was it a good way to start things off?</span>
		</p>
<br>
	<p class="name">D</p>
		<p>
		<span class="dialogue">Oh, yeah, definitely.</span>
		</p>
<br>
	<p class="name">Mark</p>
		<p>
		<span class="dialogue">Eh, well, yeah - you know, personally, I liked it a lot.</span>

<br>
	<p class="name">Cole</p>
		<p>
		<span class="dialogue">Good. ...Good.</span>
